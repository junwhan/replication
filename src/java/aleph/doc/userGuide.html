Aleph Toolkit User's Guide</H1></CENTER>

<H2>
Introduction</H2></CENTER>

This document describes how to install and run the Aleph Toolkit, a collection
of Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>tm&nbsp; </FONT></SUP>packages implementing a simple,
platform-independent distributed shared object system. For information about
the Toolkit packages themselves, please see the <I><A
HREF="tutorial.html">tutorial</A></I>.
<H1>
Installation</H1>
The Aleph toolkit encompasses a top-level <TT>aleph</TT> directory, along
with the following subdirectories:

The Aleph Run-Time System</H2>
Logically, the Aleph run-time system consists of a collection of Java Virtual
Machines called <I>PEs</I> (for <I>Processing Elements</I>). A method executing
at one PE can start a thread at another PE, and methods executing at distinct
PEs can share data objects, send messages to one another, and synchronize
on shared events<I>.</I>

<P>Physically, each PE runs on a machine (usually a workstation), called
a <I>host</I>. Multiple PEs can run at a single host. Each host that runs
an Aleph Toolkit application must also run the <I>Aleph Server</I> program.
The server's job is simply to create new PEs as requested by applications.
The server is itself a Java program, which must be started at each host
before running any applications.

<P>The user interacts with the Aleph run-time system through a program
called the <I>Aleph Console</I>. The Console provides the ability to launch
applications, to view their results, and to control system parameters such
as host identities.
<H2>
Installing Aleph</H2>
The easiest way to use Aleph is simply for each user to create a private
copy of the Aleph directory tree. Only one file needs to be modified in
a site-specific way: <B><TT><A HREF="doc/aleph.Config.html">Config.java</A></TT></B>
in the top-level directory. Each host has its own <TT>Config.java </TT>file,
and the values of the entries may well change from host to host (particularly
if the hosts run different operating systems). The following entries are
the most likely to change from one installation to another.
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD><TT>int PORT</TT></TD>

<TD>This integer, between 1024 and 65535, is the port number for all servers
running on behalf of your application. You must choose a port number distinct
from that of any other application running at the same time.&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><TT>String[] hosts</TT></TD>

<TD>An array of host names for hosts that might be running an Aleph Server.
When the Aleph console starts up, it queries these hosts to see which ones
are running an Aleph server listening on your <TT>PORT</TT> number.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><TT>String pathJava</TT></TD>

<TD>This host's path name for the Java interpreter.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
&nbsp;
<BR>The remaining fields all have sensible default values, and can be changed
after perusing the documentation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Tools</H2>
All tools in this section follow the following simple convention.&nbsp;
If no host names are specified, the tool applies to servers running at
the hosts in <TT>Config.hosts.</TT> If an integer <I>n</I> is specified,
the tool applies to the first <I>n</I> hosts in <TT>Config.hosts</TT>.&nbsp;
If explicit host names are specified, it applies to them.
<H3>
Starting Servers</H3>
The simplest way to start an Aleph server is to log in to a host, connect
to the desired directory, and explicitly start the server. Assuming your
<TT>CLASSPATH</TT> points to the root of your Aleph directory tree, start
the server with:
<DIR><TT>java aleph.comm.Server</TT></DIR>
Any PEs created by that server will have the same privileges as the server,
so if you want your application to access files in your directory, you
should start the server from your account.

<P>If you are running on a system of mutually-trusting Unix<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>tm</FONT></SUP>
workstations, then the <TT>bin</TT> directory contains a <TT>startServers</TT>
shell script that uses <TT>rsh</TT> to start up servers at the indicated
hosts in your current working directory. (Make sure that <TT>Config.pathRsh</TT>
is set to the correct pathname.)
<H3>
Shutting Down Servers</H3>
To shut down servers in an orderly way, use
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>java aleph.tools.KillServers</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The <TT>bin</TT> directory also contains a <TT>killServers</TT> shell script.
You can also use the <I>Exit &amp; Shut Down Hosts</I> entry in the console's
<I>File </I>menu (described below).
<H3>
Detecting Servers</H3>
To discover where servers are running, use
<DIR><TT>java aleph.tools.PingServers</TT></DIR>
The <TT>bin</TT> directory contains a <TT>pingServers</TT> shell script.
You can also use the <I>refresh</I> item in the console's <I>Hosts</I>
menu (described below).
<H2>
The Aleph Console</H2>
Once your servers are up and running, you can control your applications
using the Aleph <I>console</I> .
<DIR><TT>java <I>&lt;switches></I> aleph.Aleph &lt;<I>args></I></TT></DIR>
If you are running a Unix shell, you can use the <TT>aleph</TT> shell script.

<P>The console consists of two text areas and various buttons and menu
items. The <I>File </I>menu lets you shut down the console together with
all known servers, or shut down the console only. The <I>hosts </I>menu
is a tear-off menu that keeps a checkbox for each host in <A HREF="doc/aleph.Config.html#hosts"><TT><U><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Config.hosts</FONT></U></TT>.
</A>When the server starts up, it queries each of the hosts, and sets the
checkbox for each one that appears to be running a server. If you turn
the checkbox off, then the console will not use that host (although the
server will keep running). <I>Refresh</I> rechecks all the hosts for running
servers, and <I>Add </I>allows you to enter a new host where a server is
already running.&nbsp; <I>Help</I> shows current settings for System Properties
and Aleph Properties.

<P>The upper text field contains the name of your application program (as
it would appear as an argument to <TT>java</TT>) together with its arguments.&nbsp;
You can start your application by hitting <I>enter</I>, or by the green
<I>Start </I>button.&nbsp; The red <I>Stop</I> button will do its best
to stop a computation in progress.&nbsp; The <I>Clear</I> button clears
all text fields.

<P>The <I>Verbosity</I> switch controls the number of diagnostic messages
produced.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can test it at run-time by calling <TT>Aleph.getVerbosity()</TT>.&nbsp;
<I>Number PEs </I>controls how many PEs the computation will start.&nbsp;
PEs are started at hosts in round-robin order.&nbsp; The <I>Output</I>
switch controls where your aplication's output appears.&nbsp; The <I>JIT
compiler</I> switch controls the choice of JIT.&nbsp; You can add new JITs
to <TT>Config,compilers</TT>.

<P>If the <I>Profiling</I> checkbox is set, each PE will dump profiling
information into a file.&nbsp; If <I>Use java_g </I>is set, stack traces
will probably display more useful information.&nbsp; If <I>Log console
</I>is set, all output text will be logged to a file.&nbsp; Setting any
of these checkboxes may slow your computation.&nbsp; All files are created
by default in the <TT>logs</TT> subdirectory.&nbsp; The default may be
changed using <TT>Config.logDir</TT>.

<P>Aleph rebinds your application's <TT>System.out</TT> and <TT>System.err</TT>
streams o display in the lower text field.

<P>The bottom line of choices control the Communication, Directory, Event,
and Transaction managers.&nbsp; New managers can be added by changing the
<TT>Config</TT> file.
<H1>
Batch Operation</H1>
Aleph can also be run without a console (particularly useful for shell
scripts).
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>aleph -Daleph.batch=true aleph.Aleph <I>&lt;args></I></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
will immediately start up the specificed application without opening the
console.&nbsp; You can use <A HREF="alephProperties.html">aleph properties
</A>to control various options, for example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>aleph -Daleph.batch=true -Daleph.numPEs=2 aleph.Aleph <I>&lt;args></I></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
will start your application at two PEs.
<H1>
Documentation</H1>
We recommend running javadoc on the source tree.&nbsp; On most Unix shells,
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>make javadoc</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
should have the desired effect.
